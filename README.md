# Multiplayer Demo

1. I'm working on a multiplayer game, i'll be updating this as my understanding improves.
2. This is not intended for Godot beginners. If you're new to Godot this demo will likely just be confusing.
3. I have detailed tutorial comments in my scripts. I recommend reading them in this order: main.gd -> network.gd -> game_map.gd -> player.gd
